🛍️ Project Title: Retail Insights with
SQL Analytics

📄 Project Description:
This project explores a retail
sales 
dataset using SQL to uncover 
strategic business 
insights. It focuses on calculating monthly average sales,
identifying the best-selling month for each year, and pinpointing
customers who purchased across all available product categories.
The analysis demonstrates proficiency in SQL techniques such as grouping, 
filtering, subqueries, and window functions—essential 
tools for data-driven decision-making in retail environments
